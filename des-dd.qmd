## What are "Methods" in Social Epidemiology?

:::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

<br>

1. Existence of social differences in health (Descriptive)  
2. Causes of observed social differences in health (Etiologic)  

    - Overall effect of social group categories (total “effects”) 
    - Direct/Indirect effects (causal mediation)

3. [Policies to address causes]{.blue} and/or remediate social differences in health. (Policy/Intervention)

## Causal questions
:::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
We want to know:

- Did the program work? If so,for whom? If not, why not?

- If we implement the program elsewhere, should we expect the same result?

- Did it decrease inequalities?
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![Image credit: https://bit.ly/3ApemFr](images/counterfactual-image.png)
:::
::::

. . .

- These questions involve [counterfactuals]{.blue} about what would happen *if we intervened to do something*. 
- These are causal questions.

## Causation, Association, and Confounding

<br>

**Causal effect**: Do individuals [randomly assigned]{.red} to treatment have better outcomes?
$$E[Y|SET(T=1)] - E[Y|SET(T=0)]$$

. . . 

**Association**: Do treated individuals have better outcomes?
$$E[Y|T=1] - E[Y|T=0]$$

. . . 

**Confounding**: 
$$E[Y|SET(T=1)] - E[Y|SET(T=0)] \neq E[Y|T=1] - E[Y|T=0]$$

## Consequences of non-randomized treatment
:::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
- If we aren't controlling treatment assignment, who is?

- Policy programs rarely select people to treat at random.  

  - Targeting those most likely to benefit.  
  - Programs implemented in response to events.  
  - State taxes (or subsidies) for certain goods.  

- People do not choose to participate in programs at random.

  - Welfare programs, health screening programs, etc.
  - People who believe they are likely to benefit from the program.

## Thinking about research design

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
```{r, engine = 'tikz', echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
\begin{tikzpicture}[transform shape]
\tikzset{> = stealth}
    \node (z) at (0,0.5) {$Z$};
    \node (t) at (0,0) {$T$};
    \node (y) at (1,0) {$Y$};
    \node (u) at (0.5, -1) {$U$};
    \path[->] (t) edge (y);
    \path[->] (u) edge (t);
    \path[->] (u) edge (y);
\end{tikzpicture}
```
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
Without randomization $(Z)$, we focus on exploiting:

  - Treated group with **change** in exposure.
  - Comparison group without change.

Recall the potential outcomes framework. We need a substitute population (treated and controls):

$$E[Y^{1}-Y^{0}]=E[Y^{1}|T=1]-E[Y^{0}|T=0]$$

-   Where should we get our counterfactual?

## One-group posttest design with control group

```{tikz dd1, echo=F, out.width="75%", cache=TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
    \draw [<->,thick] (0,3) node (yaxis) [above] {$y$} |- (4,0) node (xaxis) [right] {$time$};
	\draw[thick, color=black, dashed] (2,0) coordinate (t0_0) -- (2,3) coordinate (t0_1);

	\draw[thick, -> ] (2.6,2.9) coordinate (t0_0) node[right] {Intervention} -- (2.1,2.9) coordinate (t0_1);

\end{tikzpicture}
```

## One-group pretest-posttest design

```{r, engine = 'tikz', out.width="75%", fig.align = "center"}

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
    
	% Draw axes
    \draw [<->,thick] (0,3) node (yaxis) [above] {$y$} |- (4,0) node (xaxis) [right] {$time$};

```

## One-group pretest-posttest design

- Even a single pretest observation provides some improvement over the
    posttest only design.

-   Now we derive a counterfactual prediction from the same group before
    the intervention.

-   Provides weak counterfactual evidence about what would have happened
    in the absence of the program.

    -   We know that $Y_{t-1}$ occurs before $Y_{t}$ (correct temporal
        ordering).

    -   Could be many other reasons apart from the intervention that
        $Y_{t}\neq Y_{t-1}$.

-   Stronger evidence if the outcomes can be reliably predicted and the
    pre-post interval is short.

-   Better still to add a pretest and posttest from a control group.

## Adding pretests for both groups

```{tikz dd3, echo=F, out.width="75%", cache=TRUE, fig.align="center"}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
    
	% Draw axes
    \draw [<->,thick] (0,3) node (yaxis) [above] {$y$} |- (4,0) node (xaxis) [right] {$time$};
	\draw[thick, color=black, dashed] (2,0) coordinate (t0_0) -- (2,3) coordinate (t0_1);
	
	% Legend
	\coordinate (T) at (4.5,2.1);
    \fill[red] (T) circle (1pt) node[right, color=black] {Treated};
	\coordinate (C) at (4.5,1.8);
    \fill[blue] (C) circle (1pt) node[right, color=black] {Control};
	
	% Intervention line
	\draw[thick, -> ] (2.6,2.9) coordinate (t0_0) node[right] {Intervention} -- (2.1,2.9) coordinate (t0_1);

	% Data points
	\coordinate (c0) at (1.5,1.5);
	\fill[blue] (c0) circle (1.5pt);
	\coordinate (t0) at (1.5,1.7);
	\fill[red] (t0) circle (1.5pt);
	\coordinate (c1) at (2.5,1.5);
	\fill[blue] (c1) circle (1.5pt);
	\coordinate (t1) at (2.5,2);
	\fill[red] (t1) circle (1.5pt);

	\draw[thick,color=blue,-] (c0) -- (c1) node[right, align=left, xshift=0.1cm] {Control group estimates \\ counterfactual trend};
	\draw[thick,color=red,-] (t0) -- (t1);
	
\end{tikzpicture}
```

## How does this help?

-   Pre/post in control helps resolve this by differencing out any
    **time-invariant** characteristics of both groups.

    -   Many observed factors don't change over the course of an
        intervention (e.g., geography, parents' social class, birth
        cohort).

    -   Any time-invariant *unobserved* factors also won't change over
        intervention period.

    -   We can therefore effectively control for them.

-   Measuring same units before and after a program cancels out any
    effect of all of the characteristics that are unique to that
    observation and that do not change over time.

-   This also has the benefit of canceling out (or controlling for)
    unobserved time-invariant characteristics.

# 2. Basics of DD

## Difference-in-Differences: Basic Idea
:::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
```{tikz dd, echo=F, out.width="80%", cache=TRUE}
\begin{tikzpicture}[transform shape]
\tikzset{> = stealth}
    \node (g) at (1,1) {$Group$};
    \node (t) at (0,0) {$T$};
    \node (y) at (2,0) {$Y$};
    \node (u) at (1, -1) {$Time$};

    \path[->] (g) edge (t);
    \path[->] (g) edge (y);
\end{tikzpicture}
```
:::

:::{.column width="70%"}

The simplest DD setting:

- Outcomes observed for "units" observed in one of two groups:

    - Treated
    - Control

- Outcomes observed in one of two time periods:

    - Before intervention
    - After intervention.

- [Treated:]{.red} only units in one of the two groups are exposed to a treatment, in the second time period.

- [Control:]{.blue} Never observed to be exposed to the treatment.

```
:::

:::{.column width="60%"}
- The average change over time in the non-exposed (control) group is subtracted from the change over time in the exposed (treatment) group.


- Double differencing removes biases in second period comparisons between the treatment and control group that could result from:

  - Fixed (i.e., non time-varying) differences between those groups.
  - Comparisons over time in the treatment group that could be the result of time trends unrelated to the treatment.
:::

## Key Assumption: Parallel Trends
:::: columns

```{r, echo=F, out.width="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "gertler-parallel.png"))
```

:::

:::{.column width="70%"}
-   Basic DD controls for any time invariant characteristics of both treated and control groups.

-   Does not control for any **time-varying** characteristics.

-   If another policy/intervention occurs in the treated (or control) group at the same time as the intervention, we cannot cleanly identify the effect of the program.

-   DD main assumption: in the absence of the intervention treated and control groups would have displayed similar **trends**.
    
- This is called the *parallel trends* assumption.

## Difference-in-Differences without Regression

DD (can be) just differences in means.

Let $\mu_{it}=E(Y_{it})$

- $i=0$ is control, $i=1$ treated.

- $t=0$ is pre, $t=1$ is post.

- One 'difference' is pre-post in treated: $\mu_{11}-\mu_{10}$

- Second 'difference' is pre-post in control: $\mu_{01}-\mu_{00}$

- Differences-in-Differences: $(\mu_{11}-\mu_{10})-(\mu_{01}-\mu_{00})$

## Difference-in-differences estimates the ATT
*Focus on treated group due to selection*  

- Our DD model is:
    $Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Treat+\beta_{2}Post+\beta_{3}Treat*Post+\varepsilon$.

-   In the (possibly counterfactual) absence of intervention, the expected outcome is:

    -   $E\left(Y_{i}^{0}|T=1,A=0\right)=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}$

-   In the (possibly counterfactual) presence of intervention, the
    expected outcome is:

    -   $E\left(Y_{i}^{1}|T=1,A=1\right)=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}+\beta_{3}$

-   ATT is the expected difference in $Y_{i}^{1}-Y_{i}^{0}$ for those
    treated in the post-period:

    -   $ATT=E\left(Y^{1}-Y^{0}|T=1\right)=\beta_{3}$

### What about multiple treated groups?

- 3 units and 3 time periods.
- Groups 1 and 3 implement policy at [T2]{.green}.

- [g2]{.blue} and [g3]{.blue} are dummies for group 2 and 3
- [t2]{.red} and [t3]{.red} are respective time dummies for periods 2 and 3.

## Extending the model to multiple groups/times
-   The regression model with group and time fixed effects would now look something like this (where $\color{red}{\beta_{5}}$ is the DD estimate where policy=1 vs. 0):

$$Y_{gt}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}g2+\beta_{2}g3+\beta_{3}t2+\beta_{4}t3+\color{red}{\beta_{5}}\color{black}{p_{gt}}+\varepsilon_{st}$$

- Reference categories (for interpreting $\beta_{0}$) are group 1 $(g1)$ and time 1 $(t1)$.

. . . 

- More generally, you could write the basic equation with multiple group $(\gamma_{g})$ and time $(\tau_{t})$ fixed effects as:

$$Y_{gt}=\alpha + \gamma_{g} + \tau_{t} + \color{red}{\delta^{DD}} \color{black}{p_{gt}}+\varepsilon_{st}$$
where $\color{red}{\delta^{DD}}$ is the difference-in-differences estimate for groups treated at time t.

Note that our basic regression model assumes the only time-varying
factor is the policy:
$$Y_{gt}=\alpha + \gamma_{g} + \tau_{t} + \color{red}{\delta^{DD}} \color{black}{p_{gt}} + \varepsilon_{gt}$$

What if there are confounders of the decision to change the policy?

We may have omitted important factors that:

  - differ by treatment status.
  - affect the outcome.
  - **are time-varying**, but not affected by the treatment $(TVC)$.
:::
::::

:::aside
The literature on covariates is evolving rapidly. See @caetano2022 for more details.
:::

## Adding time-varying covariates

- Suppose the policy is a soft drink tax and the outcome calories consumed (linear).

- We might worry that *changes in* the density of fast food restaurants could be a common cause of both. Now add measured time-varying confounders:

$$Y_{gt}=\alpha + \gamma_{g} + \tau_{t} + \color{red}{\delta^{DD}} \color{black}{p_{gt}}+ \zeta Z_{gt}+\varepsilon_{gt}$$

- where $\zeta Z_{gt}$ is a vector of other controls at the cluster level.

- Important especially if you think other policies may have been implemented simultaneously with treatment.

- Now, conditional on FEs and $\zeta Z_{gt}$, we assume that the timing of the change in policy is as good as random.

## Extensions to non-binary treatments

  - differential changes in excise taxes (smaller vs. larger).

- "Weaker" vs. "Stronger" policies

    - texting while driving (primary vs. secondary offense)

    - thresholds for blood alcohol limits (0.15 vs. 0.10 vs. 0.08).

- Using earlier treated groups as controls only 'works' if the treatment effects are:  

  - Homogeneous across groups at a given time; and
  - Homogeneous over time (no dynamic effects).

<br>

- This adds any changes in treatment effects in the early group, which get [subtracted from the DD estimate.]{.red}

- Can lead to $\beta^{DD}$ that is a poor summary of group-specific effects if there is heterogeneity.
:::

:::aside
Figure from @baker2022
:::

## What are potential solutions?

- All basically involve [not allowing]{.red} early treated groups to serve as controls later.

### Callaway and Sant'Anna
Use non-parametric group-time ATTs (+ covariates).

### Abraham and Sun
Use saturated fixed effects to ensure that prior treated units are not used as controls

### Cengiz, Dube, Lindner, and Zipperer
Create state-event-specific panel datasets and calculate event-specific estimates using separate regressions for each state-event.

### Key Takeaways
:::

::: {.column width="75%"}

- DD compares *changes* in outcomes in a treated group to a control group.

- Controls for time-invariant unobserved group factors *and* common trends in outcomes.

- Requires good qualitative knowledge about *why* the treated group became treated.

- Core assumption is parallel trends, unverifiable but not impossible to investigate.

- Can be extended to address inequalities, but stronger assumptions needed.

- Strong designs like DD can help reduce the "evidence gap".
